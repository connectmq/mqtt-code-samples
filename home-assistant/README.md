Connect Home Assistant to an MQTT broker and turn MQTT messages into sensors. Start on the free public broker, then point the same code at a secure private broker on ConnectMQ.

> **Built for [ConnectMQ](https://connectmq.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=home-assistant-intro)** — the managed, serverless MQTT broker for IoT. Try this example on the free public broker in seconds, then move the very same code to a secure private broker with a free ConnectMQ account. 👉 [Start for free](https://app.connectmq.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=home-assistant-intro)

## Requirements

- **Library:** [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)


## Files

| Folder | Broker | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`public-broker/`](public-broker/) | Free public broker `broker.connectmq.com` | Connect without an account, subscribe and publish a JSON reading |
| [`private-broker/`](private-broker/) | Your private ConnectMQ broker | The same flow over TLS with your username and password |

## How to run

1. Add the **MQTT** integration (Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → MQTT) with the broker details below.
2. Paste `configuration.yaml` into your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` and restart.
3. Publish a test reading from **Developer tools → Actions** with `developer-tools-action.yaml`.

---

## 1. Try it on the free public broker (no account needed)

No account needed: connect to broker.connectmq.com on port 1883 and start publishing in seconds.

| Protocol | URL |
| --- | --- |
| MQTT (TCP) | `mqtt://broker.connectmq.com:1883` |
| MQTT over TLS | `mqtts://broker.connectmq.com:8883` |
| WebSocket | `ws://broker.connectmq.com:8083/mqtt` |
| Secure WebSocket | `wss://broker.connectmq.com:8084/mqtt` |

**`configuration.yaml`** ([open file](public-broker/configuration.yaml))

```yaml
# Broker: Settings > Devices & services > MQTT, host broker.connectmq.com, port 1883
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Living room temperature"
      # Messages on this topic become a temperature sensor
      state_topic: "your-project/sensors/temperature"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
      device_class: temperature
```

**Developer tools → Actions — `developer-tools-action.yaml`** ([open file](public-broker/developer-tools-action.yaml))

```yaml
# Publish a JSON reading
action: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: "your-project/sensors/temperature"
  payload: '{"temperature":21.5}'
```

> ⚠️ **The public broker is shared:** anyone can subscribe to any topic, including yours. Never send passwords, personal data or anything confidential through it, and use a unique topic prefix (`your-project/...`) so your messages don't mix with others'. There is no guarantee of availability or message retention. [About the free public MQTT broker](https://connectmq.com/public-mqtt-broker/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=home-assistant-public)

## 2. Go to production with a private ConnectMQ broker

For real devices, use a private serverless MQTT broker on ConnectMQ instead of the public one: TLS encryption, a username and password for every device and per-topic access control, fully managed. The Serverless (Free) plan needs no credit card.

**Get your private broker in under a minute:**

1. [Create a free ConnectMQ account](https://app.connectmq.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=home-assistant-private) — no credit card.
2. Create a broker in the dashboard (the **Serverless (Free)** plan is enough to start).
3. Copy the **host**, **username** and **password** of your broker.
4. Replace `YOUR_BROKER_HOST`, `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` in the files under [`private-broker/`](private-broker/) and run them.

**`configuration.yaml`** ([open file](private-broker/configuration.yaml))

```yaml
# Broker: Settings > Devices & services > MQTT, host YOUR_BROKER_HOST, port 8883, TLS on, username and password from ConnectMQ
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Living room temperature"
      # Messages on this topic become a temperature sensor
      state_topic: "your-project/sensors/temperature"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
      device_class: temperature
```

**Developer tools → Actions — `developer-tools-action.yaml`** ([open file](private-broker/developer-tools-action.yaml))

```yaml
# Publish a JSON reading
action: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: "your-project/sensors/temperature"
  payload: '{"temperature":21.5}'
```

### What you get with a private broker

- 🔒 **TLS encryption** on every connection (port 8883, secure WebSocket 8084)
- 🔑 **A username and password per device**, created in the dashboard
- 🛡️ **Per-topic access control (ACL)** — decide which client may publish or subscribe to which topic
- 📊 **Devices & connections dashboard** — live device status, last values, connection history
- ⚡ **Fully managed and serverless** — no servers to patch or scale
