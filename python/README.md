Connect Python to an MQTT broker with paho-mqtt. Start on the free public broker, then point the same code at a secure private broker on ConnectMQ.

> **Built for [ConnectMQ](https://connectmq.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=python-intro)** — the managed, serverless MQTT broker for IoT. Try this example on the free public broker in seconds, then move the very same code to a secure private broker with a free ConnectMQ account. 👉 [Start for free](https://app.connectmq.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=python-intro)

Full walkthrough on the website: **[Python MQTT example](https://connectmq.com/code-samples/python/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=python-intro)**

## Requirements

- **Library:** [paho-mqtt 2.x](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
- **Install:**

```bash
pip install "paho-mqtt>=2.0"
```

## Files

| Folder | Broker | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`public-broker/`](public-broker/) | Free public broker `broker.connectmq.com` | Connect without an account, subscribe and publish a JSON reading |
| [`private-broker/`](private-broker/) | Your private ConnectMQ broker | The same flow over TLS with your username and password |

## How to run

```bash
cd public-broker   # or private-broker
pip install "paho-mqtt>=2.0"
python main.py
```

---

## 1. Try it on the free public broker (no account needed)

No account needed: connect to broker.connectmq.com on port 1883 and start publishing in seconds.

| Protocol | URL |
| --- | --- |
| MQTT (TCP) | `mqtt://broker.connectmq.com:1883` |
| MQTT over TLS | `mqtts://broker.connectmq.com:8883` |
| WebSocket | `ws://broker.connectmq.com:8083/mqtt` |
| Secure WebSocket | `wss://broker.connectmq.com:8084/mqtt` |

**`main.py`** ([open file](public-broker/main.py))

```python
import json
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

TOPIC = "your-project/sensors/temperature"  # Use a unique topic prefix: everyone can read the public broker

# Runs when the connection is established
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, reason_code, properties):
    print("Connected:", reason_code)
    # Subscribe to the temperature topic
    client.subscribe(TOPIC, qos=1)
    # Publish a JSON reading
    client.publish(TOPIC, json.dumps({"temperature": 21.5}), qos=1)

# Runs for every message on a subscribed topic
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(msg.topic, msg.payload.decode())

client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the free public broker (no account needed)
client.connect("broker.connectmq.com", 1883)
# Keep the client running
client.loop_forever()
```

> ⚠️ **The public broker is shared:** anyone can subscribe to any topic, including yours. Never send passwords, personal data or anything confidential through it, and use a unique topic prefix (`your-project/...`) so your messages don't mix with others'. There is no guarantee of availability or message retention.

## 2. Go to production with a private ConnectMQ broker

For real devices, use a private serverless MQTT broker on ConnectMQ instead of the public one: TLS encryption, a username and password for every device and per-topic access control, fully managed. The Serverless (Free) plan needs no credit card.

**Get your private broker in under a minute:**

1. [Create a free ConnectMQ account](https://app.connectmq.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code-samples&utm_campaign=mqtt-code-samples&utm_content=python-private) — no credit card.
2. Create a broker in the dashboard (the **Serverless (Free)** plan is enough to start).
3. Copy the **host**, **username** and **password** of your broker.
4. Replace `YOUR_BROKER_HOST`, `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` in the files under [`private-broker/`](private-broker/) and run them.

**`main.py`** ([open file](private-broker/main.py))

```python
import json
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

TOPIC = "your-project/sensors/temperature"

# Runs when the connection is established
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, reason_code, properties):
    print("Connected:", reason_code)
    # Subscribe to the temperature topic
    client.subscribe(TOPIC, qos=1)
    # Publish a JSON reading
    client.publish(TOPIC, json.dumps({"temperature": 21.5}), qos=1)

# Runs for every message on a subscribed topic
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(msg.topic, msg.payload.decode())

client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Username and password from your ConnectMQ dashboard
client.username_pw_set("YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_PASSWORD")
# TLS: the system CA store verifies the broker certificate
client.tls_set()

# Connect to your private ConnectMQ broker on port 8883
client.connect("YOUR_BROKER_HOST", 8883)
# Keep the client running
client.loop_forever()
```

### What you get with a private broker

- 🔒 **TLS encryption** on every connection (port 8883, secure WebSocket 8084)
- 🔑 **A username and password per device**, created in the dashboard
- 🛡️ **Per-topic access control (ACL)** — decide which client may publish or subscribe to which topic
- 📊 **Devices & connections dashboard** — live device status, last values, connection history
- ⚡ **Fully managed and serverless** — no servers to patch or scale

## Public vs. private broker

| | Free public broker | Private broker on ConnectMQ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account | Not needed | Free sign-up, no credit card |
| Host | `broker.connectmq.com` | Your own broker host |
| Who can read your topics | **Anyone** | Only your devices |
| Encryption | Optional (TLS on 8883) | TLS on every connection |
| Authentication | None | Username and password per device |
| Topic access control (ACL) | No | Yes, per topic and per client |
| Device & connection dashboard | No | Yes |
| Use it for | Learning, demos, quick tests | Real devices and production |
